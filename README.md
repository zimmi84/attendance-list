# attendance-list
with this program you can create an excel for a training attendance list

## Usage

It is necessary to have two files on the same path prepared.
- teamDa.xlsx
- teamDb.xlsx
Each file must have a row "surname" and "lastname" otherwise the python script is not able to import the attendance/players to your attendance list.

```bash
python create-attendance-list.py
```
